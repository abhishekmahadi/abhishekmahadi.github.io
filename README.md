### Projects 
#### Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning
In this project, I used a dataset of housing prices to build a regression model that predicts house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. I employed Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib to preprocess the data, train and evaluate the model, and visualize the results.
